abstract: >
  The LFT Case Study is a browser-based educational tool that supports learners in interpreting liver
  function test (LFT) results through a guided clinical reasoning pathway. It presents realistic cases and 
  structured decision-making tasks to help users identify patterns of liver dysfunction, including hepatocellular 
  injury and cholestasis. Designed for use in medical and biomedical education, this tool enhances diagnostic skills 
  and supports active learning. For educational use only.
