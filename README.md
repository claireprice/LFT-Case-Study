## Overview

**LFT Case Study** is an interactive, browser-based teaching tool that guides users through the interpretation of **liver function tests (LFTs)** using structured clinical reasoning.

Learners work through step-by-step questions involving:
- Liver enzyme patterns (e.g., ALT, AST, ALP)
- Bilirubin and albumin levels
- Possible causes based on lab results and symptoms

This tool supports understanding of how LFTs relate to different types of liver pathology, including hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and synthetic dysfunction.
